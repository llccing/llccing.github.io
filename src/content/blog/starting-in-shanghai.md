description: After six months at Accenture, I am enjoying my work with Angular 18 and learning Agile methodologies. I aim to obtain an AWS SAA certification. Personally, I've secured a Shanghai Residence Permit for my child's kindergarten while balancing family responsibilities as Tina starts a new job.

<!-- Currently, just finish my first half year in Accenture. and I the life at here, you win some, you lose some.

the work at here, to maintain the project, and which already upgrade from angular 2 to angular 18, and the biggest chanllege part is to learn the old logic, because when you want to update thing, you need to make sure you will not break others. the pros are now it’s angular 18, so you can use the new feature, such as signal, or @if, etc.

And the foreign company, work life balance can make sure. The colleague can handle their own things. but if you want to know something from them, it’s better to search the conference first and check the jira.

also at Accenture, i have learned the Agile, we have Scrum master, Project owner, Solution lead, Business analysis. also the planning, daily team sync, backlog refinement, retro. I think this part is the most important and treasure for mine career. The other thing is English, i have the oppotunerty to speak and write in English. And I have know that my level currently is B1, that’s a good thing. because in previous time, i have no idea about my English level.

so for the work part, next goal is to learn more about the business so that i will have more confident to implement the next feature. and to get a cloud certificate, first one is AWS SAA, this is for future job, because i think in the future all the project is on cloud, or hybrid project, half is on-premesis and half is in cloud. also the locale company just follow the prior leader’s step, such as AWS Cloud. so a cloud certificate will also help with my career. This is in progress, and i even learn more during this preparation of the exam. and to continue to learn English, coz this English skill really help me to get a better job.

And for life part, I have got the 上海居住证, and just hope this can help my baby to go to the public kindergarten which near the rent house. For the rent, it’s expensive but still affordable, also no other choices. and currently, Tina has found a job, although it’s might not the most suitable for her. But anyway it’s a job can have things to do. And my father-in-law can help to pick the baby from the private kindergarten, the private one it’s expensive, but i just treat it as the someone can help to care  the baby. you know, find a someone to look after a baby it’s very expensive in shanghai. so this cost are also acceptable.

So inclusion, everything goes in their way, and i will continue to grow up, to learn more. also to continue take care of my small family, Juli, Tina, and my big family (parents, brother, parent-in-law). -->

I have recently completed my first six months at Accenture, and I am thoroughly enjoying my experience here. Life unfolds with its ups and downs.

My work involves maintaining a project that has advanced from Angular 2 to Angular 18. The most significant challenge lies in understanding the legacy code; one must ensure that updates do not disrupt existing functionality. On the brighter side, with Angular 18, we can leverage new features such as signals and the @if directive.

In this international company, a favorable work-life balance is maintained. Colleagues are responsible for their own tasks, but it is advisable to consult the conference first and check Jira if one seeks information from them.

At Accenture, I have gained valuable insights into Agile methodology. We have roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, Solution Lead, and Business Analyst, along with regular planning sessions, daily team synchronization, backlog refinement, and retrospectives. I believe this aspect is the most significant and valuable for my career. Additionally, I have the opportunity to communicate and write in English. I have assessed my proficiency at a B1 level, which is encouraging, especially since I previously lacked an understanding of my English capabilities.

Regarding my professional goals, I aim to deepen my understanding of the business to enhance my confidence in implementing future features and to obtain a cloud certification, starting with AWS SAA. I believe that, in the future, all projects will predominantly be cloud-based or hybrid, with a blend of on-premises and cloud solutions. Local companies tend to follow the lead of prior innovators, like AWS Cloud, making a cloud certification beneficial for my career. This journey is ongoing, and I am already learning extensively while preparing for the exam, while also continuing to enhance my English skills, which are essential for securing better job opportunities.

On a personal note, I have obtained a Shanghai Residence Permit and hope it will facilitate my child's enrollment in a nearby public kindergarten. Although the rent is expensive, it remains manageable, and options are limited. Fortunately, Tina has secured a job, though it may not be the most ideal for her. However, it is still employment that keeps her engaged. My father-in-law is available to pick up our child from the private kindergarten, which, while costly, I consider a worthwhile investment for quality childcare, especially given the exorbitant rates for babysitters in Shanghai.

In conclusion, everything is progressing as it should, and I will continue to grow and learn. I am also committed to caring for my small family—Juli, Tina—and my extended family, including my parents, brother, and in-laws.
